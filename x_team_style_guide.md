# X-Team 68 Style Guide

<We will focus on making our coding style consistent. We will use basic/generic commenting style, and make sure to comment on complicated code that might confuse the group.>

## Naming conventions

We are going to use the naming convetions that we used in CS300.

### Examples
* interfaces: We will use caps for interfaces e.g. "InterfaceName"
* classes: We will use caps for classes e.g. "ClassName"
* exception types: We will use caps for exeptions e.g. "ExceptionName"
* fields: lower case with camel casing e.g. "fieldName"
* methods: lower case with camel casing e.g. "methodName"
* parameters: lower case with camel casing e.g. "parameterName"
* local variables: lower case with camel casing e.g. "localVariableName"
* instance constants: All caps with underscores e.g. "INSTANCE_CONSTANTS"
* class constants: All caps with underscores e.g. "CLASS_CONSTANTS"

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

Use inline comments to clarify. And javadocs for public and private feilds

### Examples

* classes
* fields
* constructors
* methods
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
