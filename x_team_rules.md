# X-Team 68 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will assign tasks by dividing the work equally among us, and communicating throughout to make sure that none of the work slips between the cracks or goes unnoticed.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will check each others code for functionality. We will also set mini-deadlines to stay on track. Write tests as we go to double check the code.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will use our group message to ask for help when needed. We will not wait until the last minute to ensure there is enough time to complete the project.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
